How To Play
------------------
Launch 'Hold Space To Play.exe'. By default, the game starts in fullscreen. To change this, visit 'Options'. You'll also find volume and control options here.

The game launches with only one button supported: the space bar.
Tap space rapidly to select an option, and hold space to activate that option. If you wish to cancel an action, continue holding for 5 seconds until the action cancels.

There's two control schemes available, they're explained better in the 'Options' menu.

To uninstall this game, delete the entire 'Hold Space To Play v1.1' folder.

------------------
Changelog for v1.1
------------------
MAJOR
- New control scheme. Two buttons instead of three. Can be set in 'Options'.
- Resolution and control options added to 'Options' menu.

MINOR
- Space bar only needs to be held for 0.4s, down from 0.5s.
- Camera altered to focus on the center of the character.
- Level layouts are slightly changed. Especially in Level 8, as jumps are more forgiving.
- Text changed in places, 'Options' menu layout improved.

BUG FIXES
- Flags and locks can no longer be activated multiple times. Prevents multiple level ending sounds, and softlocks related to not having enough keys respectively.

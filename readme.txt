How To Play
Launch 'holdspace.exe'. Choose your resolution and other settings here.
The game launches with only one control scheme supported: the space bar.
Tap space rapidly to select an option, and hold space to activate that option. If you wish to cancel an action, continue holding for 5 seconds until the action cancels.

How To Play
------------------
Launch the 'Hold Space To Play' executable (File ending in .exe, .x86_64).
Visit 'Options' to change volume, full-screen, language, and control options.

The game is played with only one button: the space bar.
Tap space rapidly to select an option, and hold space to activate that option. Release space to cancel the action.

There's two control schemes available, which are explained in the 'Options' menu.

To uninstall this game, delete the folder the game came in.

OS Specific Instructions

Linux - Game may not work immediately. Go to the executable's 'Properties, Permissions' and check the box for 'Allow executing file as program'. Or you could run "chmod +x" on the executable to mark it as an executable.

Changelog for v1.1
------------------
MAJOR
- New control scheme. Two buttons instead of three. Can be set in 'Options'.
- New camera system. Shows more of the screen and moves around smoothly.
- Resolution and control options added to 'Options' menu.

MINOR
- Space bar only needs to be held for 0.4s, down from 0.5s.
- Level layouts are slightly changed. Especially in Level 8, as jumps are more forgiving.
- Text changed in places, 'Options' menu layout improved.

BUG FIXES
- Flags and locks can no longer be activated multiple times. Prevents multiple level ending sounds, and softlocks related to not having enough keys respectively.
- Music and sound volume can now be changed after starting the game and leaving.
- Glitchy double-jumps can't be performed inside one-way platforms anymore. Helps with ascending Level 8.
- The player no longer instantly stops if the same left/right action is performed twice. However, changing direction (intentionally) still instantly stops them from moving their prior direction.
